			<a href="#writing">Writing</a> |
			<a href="#tutorials">Tutorials</a>

			<p>
				I'm a data scientist and (self-proclaimed) engineer building
				tools for decision making and strategy. Since 2020, I've been at
				Netflix focusing on experimentation and observational causal
				inference.
			</p>

			<p>
				My background is in computational social science. Although I use
				a range of quantitative methods in my work, I believe the best
				insights and predictions are formed when large-scale data and
				automation are combined with careful human judgement and
				curation.
			</p>

			<p>
				I'm from Sweden 🇸🇪, where I enjoyed a short pro football
				(fine... soccer) career before going to the US for college and a
				PhD. I live in Los Angeles with my wife, son, and daughter. My
				last name is pronounced AY-duh-meer. Feel free to connect on
				<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-ejdemyr-22b920123/">
				LinkedIn</a>.
            </p>

			<h2 id="things-i-do">Things I do </h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Build products and tools to make sense of complex data</li>
				<li>Design systems for randomized controlled trials and
				observational causal inference</li>
				<li>Develop, prototype, and productize machine learning and
				inference models based on analytical solvers or (Bayesian)
				probabilistic programming</li>
				<li>Use Python, R, SQL, bash, Stan, and more; and contribute to
				and design APIs</li>
				<li>Enjoy teaching and mentoring (in 2016 I won Stanford's <a
					href="https://ctl.stanford.edu/cta-winners"> Centennial Teaching
					Award)</a> </li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="tutorials">Tutorials</h2>
			<p>
				At Stanford I taught classes in applied statistics, for which I
				developed a number of R tutorials. While likely out of date,
				I've heard some are still useful.
