			<a href="#tutorials">Tutorials</a>

			<p>
				I'm a data scientist and engineer building tools for decision
				making and strategy. Since 2020, I've been at Netflix focusing
				on experimentation and causal inference.
			</p>

			<p>
				My background is in computational social science. Although I use
				a range of quantitative methods in my work, I believe the best
				insights and predictions are formed when large-scale data and
				automation are married with careful human judgement and curation.
			</p>

			<p>
				I'm from Sweden 🇸🇪, where I both worked in a warehouse and
				enjoyed a short pro soccer career before going to the US for
				college and a PhD. I'm just about to move to Los Angeles with my
				wife, son, and daughter. My last name is pronounced AY-duh-meer.

			<h2 id="things-i-do">Things I do </h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Build products and tools to make sense of complex data,
				resulting in faster and higher-quality decision making</li>
				<li>Design systems for experimentation (randomized controlled
				trials, A/B testing) and observational causal inference</li>
				<li>Develop, prototype, and productize large-scale machine
				learning and inference models based on analytical solvers or
				(Bayesian) probabilistic programming</li>
				<li>Use Python, R, SQL, bash, Stan, and more; and contribute to
				and design APIs</li>
				<li>Like to keep things <a

					as simple as possible, but not simpler</a>, balancing
					theoretical rigor and practical concerns</li>
				<li>Enjoy teaching and mentoring (in 2016 I won Stanford's <a
					href="https://ctl.stanford.edu/cta-winners"> Centennial Teaching
					Award)</a> </li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="tutorials">Tutorials</h2>
			<p>
				At Stanford I taught classes in applied statistics, for which I
				developed a number of R tutorials. While likely out of date,
				I've heard some are still useful.
