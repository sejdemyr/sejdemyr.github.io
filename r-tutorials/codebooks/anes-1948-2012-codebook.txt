VCF0006a       Unique Respondent Number
=============================================================================

QUESTION:
---------
Unique identification number

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
For non-panel cases this corresponds to 4-digit year of study followed
by 4-digit case id from the study as found in VCF0006.
For panel cases, this corresponds to 4-digit year of first year of 
time-series participation followed by 4-digit case id from first 
participation study .  For example, 1958 ANES panel cases (first 
interviewed in the 1956 anes) are numbered 1956xxxx where xxxx 
corresponds to the case ID the respondent had been assigned previously 
in the 1956 study; VCF0006, by contrast, includes the respondent's 1958 
NES case ID. 
Studies including panel cases as part of the overall study cross-section
are flagged in VCF00016.
1958 NOTE:
In the 1958 anes time-series study, V580007 and V580008 flags whether 
1958 respondents were previously interviewed in 1956.  However, some 
respondents flagged in these variables had been interviewed in 1956 not 
as part of the 1956 anes study's cross-section sample, but as part of a 
sample component intended for a separate 'panel' (non-cross-section) 
file.  Thus the actual count of cases from the 1958 study having 1956 
unique IDs in VCF0006a (as 1956xxxx, where xxxx is the 1956 ANES 
cross-section case ID) does not correspond with the count of cases 
flagged in V580007 and V580008 for previous participation in 1956.
1960 NOTE:
see 1958 note; cases flagged in the 1960 ANES study for participation 
prior to 1960 may have participated outside of the time-series cross-
section(s) in the year(s) of prior participation and may not correspond
to the count of cases found here for initial time-series participation.

GENERAL NOTE:
See also VCF0012A, VCF0012B.  This describes paper questionnaires
(1948-1994).
1972 NOTE 1:  
57 Rs who were Pre Form I and 37 Rs who were Pre Form II were sent post
mail questionnaires that contained most, but not all, of Form I/ Form 
II Post personal questions.  Rs who were Form I in the Pre but 
administered Post mail questionnaires were designated "FORM III" in the 
Post, while Rs who were Form II in the Pre but who completed mail 
questionnaires for the Post were Post "FORM  IV".
1972 NOTE 2: 
The same Form type was assigned in the Post as in the Pre.
1986 NOTE: 
Form A questions were not asked of Form B respondents and vice versa, 
with two exceptions: both were asked VCF0830, with varied wording.
1988 NOTE 1: 
Unlike other years, in 1988 all questions were present in both Form A 
and Form B, however some differed by form in wording or placement: e.g.
VCF0517-VCF0518, VCF0830, VCF9076, VCF9084, VCF9092.
1988 NOTE 2: 
same as 1972 NOTE 2.
1994 NOTE: 
In 1994, the study included a 'ballot card' experiment.  Two ballot 
cards were drafted with identical content but different layout.

GENERAL NOTE: 
See also VCF0012.
CAPI administration (Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing) began in
1996. VCF0012A and VCF0012B describe CAPI handling of substantive 
content according to original study design. Vars VCF0012/VCF0012A/ 
VCF0012B differ from VCF0015A/B in that shortened interviews described 
in the latter are the result of problem, error, or late field-period 
adjustments.
1996 NOTE:
Half-samples were randomly selected for each set of 1996 questions F1-
F4 and H4-H8: VCF0314-VCF0324 (from series F1-F4); VCF0522 (from H1-H4).
2000 NOTE: 
Half-samples were randomly selected for section E and F6-F9; 
respondents not selected for Pre administration of section E were 
assigned to Post administration:  VCF0880, VCF0881 (from E series); 
VCF0875, VCF9012 (from F6-F9). Respondents were also randomly selected 
to be administered Clinton traits and affects in either the Pre or the 
Post: VCF0338, VCF0342-VCF0349.
2002 NOTE: 
Respondents were randomly assigned to either K1 or K2 series of Federal 
budget spending items: VCF0886, VCF0887, VCF0888, VCF0889, VCF0890, 
VCF0892, VCF0894, VCF9047, VCF9049, and VCF9050.
2004 NOTE:
Respondents were randomly assigned to a battery of patriotism questions
in the Pre or the Post.
2008 NOTE:
The 2008 study included many splits for question version; the 
principal split was for versions "OLD" (standard) versus "NEW"
(revised), which applied to a selected set of questions in both the Pre 
and Post interviews; the selection included most 7-point scales (and
their alternatives).  Assignment to OLD or NEW was the same for both
Pre and Post.

GENERAL NOTE:
This describes the presence of post-election data in ANES pre-post
time-series studies: studies conducted in years of presidential 
elections and in 2002 were pre-post studies. In non-presidential years 
except 1954 and 2002, ANES has conducted a Post-election interview only, 
and all non-presidential years other than 1954 and 2002 have been coded
1.*  2002 is the only non-presidential-year study which is a Pre-Post 
study.

1956 NOTE: 
No cases without post-election re-interviews were included in the 
final 1956 dataset. 
1968 NOTE: 
9 cases which were no-Post had some information about voting
behavior noted on their coversheets:  although defined as "no-Post,"
these cases were nonetheless represented in (post) vote variables in
the original dataset, and such coversheet-derived vote information has
also been included in Cumulative Data File voting variables where
appropriate.

1992 NOTE:  
In addition to 'long-form' or full personal mode questionnaires, short-
form telephone questionnaires were prepared in both the Pre and Post 
waves for out-of-range panel cases.  Please see the full 1992 ANES 
documentation for a complete description. Note that, contrary to 
intentions, use of the short-form questionnaire was not limited to 
telephone mode, nor was long-form use confined to personal mode. [In 
a few cases the shorter interview was administered to 'fresh' cross-
section respondents-- 4 cases Pre, 4 cases Post].
1996 NOTE:  
The Pre 'VQ file' or CAPI application was revised several times while 
in the field.  Beginning with the instrument with revision date 9/25/96,
some questions (most of the items related to 1996 candidate Ross Perot) 
were dropped from the Pre. 
2000 NOTE: 
In the Pre, Buchanan traits and affects were dropped beginning with 
the 09/28/00 VQ.

Abbreviated interview form - Post

VALID_CODES:
------------
0. Post IW is not abbreviated 
   [1952: extended form B re-interview; 1984: personal 
   IW; 1992: 'long' form Post incl. Spanish Post]
1. Abbreviated Post IW
   [1952 N=585: not the extended re-interview with
   29 additional questions; 1968 mail questionnaire N=36;
   1972 Form III mail quesionnaire N=57; 1984 telephone 
   questionnaire N=966 ; 1992 short-form N=190 ; 1996 
   training VQ N=39]
2. Additional Abbreviated Post IWs
   [1972 Form IV mail questionnaire N=37; 1984 
   abbreviated telephone questionnaire N=45]

MISSING_CODES:
--------------
Inap. no post IW

NOTES:
------
1952 NOTE:
In 1952 some respondents were sent an extended version of the post
questionnaire ("form B"); caes not administered this extended Post
re-interview are coded 1.
1968 NOTE:
In the 1968 post, some respondents were sent mail questionnaires which
contained fewer questions than in the full face-to-face questionnaire.
1972 NOTE:
In the 1972 post, some respondents were sent mail questionnaires which
contained fewer questions than in the full face-to-face questionnaire:
respondents who were Form I in the Pre (see VCF0012) and who were 
interviewed in the Post using the mail questionnaire were designated 
"Form III" in the Post; respondents who were Form II in the Pre and who 
were interviewed in the Post using the mail questionnaire were 
designated "Form IV" in the Post
1984 NOTE:
In addition to the 1984 telephone Post questionnaire, which was shorter
than the 1984 Post personal questionnaire, an abbreviated version of the
Post telephone questionnaire was also administered to 45 cases.
1992 NOTE:  
In addition to 'long-form' or full personal mode questionnaires, short-
form telephone questionnaires were prepared in both the Pre and Post 
waves for out-of-range panel cases.  Please see the full 1992 ANES 
documentation for a complete description. Note that, contrary to 
intentions, use of the short-form questionnaire was not limited to 
telephone mode, nor was long-form use confined to personal mode. [In 
a few cases the shorter interview was administered to 'fresh' cross-
section respondents-- 4 cases Pre, 4 cases Post].
1996 NOTE:  
The Post 'VQ file' or CAPI application was revised several times while 
in the field.  Some cases in the Post were mistakenly administered 
using a pre-production (training) VQ file which lacked several 
intended questions.

                1996 N=1316; 2002 N=1187)

NOTES:
------
GENERAL  NOTE: 
Ns indicated below are unweighted. The combined sample of panel and 
fresh-cross cases together constitute an overall representative cross-
section for the time-series study.  Panel cases in 1958,1960,1974 and
1976 are not flagged in the data of the respective time-series studies;
for these years this variable has been coded from the 1956-1958-1960
and 1972-1974-1976 merged panel files.
1958 NOTE:
Panel cases had previously been interviewed in 1956 (note: the number
of panel caes in the 1958 time-series data file does not correspond with
the number of 1958 panel cases in the 1956-1958-1960 merged panel file)
1960 NOTE:
Panel cases had previously been interviewed in 1956 or 1958 (note: the 
number of panel caes in the 1950 time-series data file does not 
correspond with the number of 1950 panel cases in the 1956-1958-1960 
merged panel file)
1974 NOTE:
Panel cases had previously been interviewed in 1972 (note: the number
of panel caes in the 1974 time-series data file does not correspond with
the number of 1974 panel cases in the 1972-1974-1976 merged panel file)
1976 NOTE:
Panel cases had previously been interviewed in 1972 or 1974 (note: the 
number of panel caes in the 1975 time-series data file does not 
correspond with the number of 1976 panel cases in the 1972-1974-1976 
merged panel file)
1992 NOTE: 
Panel cases had previously been interviewed in 1990.
1994 NOTE: 
Panel cases had previously been interviewed in 1992, as 1992 new fresh 
Cross-Section cases (no 1994 Panel cases had been interviewed in 1990).
1996 NOTE:  
Panel cases had previously been interviewed in 1994, and a portion had 
also been interviewed in 1992.
2002 NOTE:

VCF0017        Mode of Interview
=============================================================================

QUESTION:
---------
Mode of interview: personal ("face-to-face") or telephone

VALID_CODES:
------------
0. Personal (pre-post studies: personal pre and post
            or personal pre and no post; post studies:
            personal post)
1. Telephone pre (personal post or no post)
2. Telephone post (personal pre or no pre)
3. Telephone pre and post

NOTES:
------
1992 NOTE: 
A shorter questionnaire was designed for telephone interviewing only, 
where telephone administration was intended for selected Panel cases; 
all long-form questionnaires were designed to be administered in 
person.  However, due to interviewer misunderstanding, 125 Pre 
interviews and 284 Post interviews -- including both Panel and new 
Cross-Section respondents --were administered over the telephone using 
long-form questionnaires.  Mode of interview here thus cannot be 
identified with short or long questionnaire (VCF0015a,VCF0015b).  [Note: 
additionally, in 1 Pre case a Panel short-form interview was conducted 
in person.]
1998 NOTE:
This is the beginning mode of the interview; in some cases, the 
interview may have been suspended and completed in a different mode.
2000 NOTE: 
Code 1 includes 5 cases which were personal in the Pre and intended to 
be switched to phone mode in the Post, but which were again 
administered face-to-face.

NOTES:

GENERAL NOTE:
Prior to 1964 this appeared as a coded staff summary (not as a survey
question).
Except for 1968, in Pre-Post studies this variable is pre-election.
Beginning in 1964, age variables in ANES Study datasets were created by 
computing R's age from his/her given date of birth (beginning in 1988, 
when birthdate was not available, age as given for household listing by 
R/informant was used instead).  The age calculation used in these 
Study datasets determined age at date of interview  in 1966, 1968, 
1970, 1972 and 1980-1994; it represented age on November 1 of the year 
of interview in 1976 and 1978.  In 1974, age on election day  of the 
year of interview was calculated.  For 1964, no documentation is extant 
describing exact calculation made.
Prior to 1964, instead of age calculated using R's birthdate, age
as given by R/informant (this information may have come from the
coversheet) is represented.
1948 NOTE:
Age var was in the form of age groups and could not be included (see 
VCF0102).
1954 NOTE:
same as 1948.
1960 NOTE:
Personal data forms were completed for no-pre cases: data from these 
forms were incorporated into the (pre) age var listed.
1992 NOTE:
Birthdate was not asked in short-form interviews:  for panel 'short-
form' cases, 2 years were added to the age that appeared in the 1990 
study; for short-form 'fresh' cross-section cases, age was pulled from 
the coversheet.
2002 NOTE:
For panel cases, 2 years were added to the age (if determined) that 
appeared in the 2000 study.
2008 NOTE:
Age was calculated from year of birth.

NOTES:

GENERAL NOTE:
When variables for IWR observation of race were present in both the Pre
and Post, the Pre variable has been utilized (1960,1972,1976,1980-1986).
In years prior to 1972, race was identified by interviewer observation
alone. Beginning in 1972, respondents were also asked for ethnic
self-identification.  VCF0106a includes only the IWR observation race 
data for 1948-1970, but reclassifies IWR observation race of 1972-1998 
respondents who were observed as White or Other if their primary 
(first) mention for ethnic self-identification was a Black, Asian, 
Native American, or Hispanic mention.  (These reclassifications of race 
from specific mentions for ethnic/national self-identification are in 
conformity with available Census definitions).
1960 NOTE:
The Pre variable incorporated data from Post race variable V600249
to establish the race of 22 no-pre cases.
1992 NOTE:
Interviewer observation of race was not part of the 'short-form' 
questionnaire; for short-form panel cases, however, 1990 study data 
were incorporated.
2000 NOTE:
Interviewer observation was not utilized for identification of 
respondent race. Instead, respondents were first asked to self-identify 
their own racial group and were then asked for their ethnic self-
identification.  Respondents with a primary (first) mention for race
which was not Black, Asian, Native American or Hispanic had race
reclassified in VCF0106a for race from primary ethnic self-
identification in the same manner as for 1972-1998.
2002 NOTE:
The ethnicity question was not asked and this variable was coded from 
the racial self-identification mentions.  Since order of mentions was 
not determined, combined mention of white and other racial group has 
been recoded to the nonwhite racial group.
2004 NOTE:
same as 2000.
1 case of middle-eastern respondent who identified self as Asian (in
British fashion) has been coded to 1.

ethnicity questions [SEE VCF0109] whether s/he is Hispanic.  Prior to
1988, information about Hispanic origin was determined only by
interviewer observation.
1978 NOTE:
A large number (171) of NAs appeared in the Study data.
1980 NOTE:
A Hispanic origin variable was present in both the pre and post.  The 
pre version is represented here.
1984 NOTE:
same as 1980
1992 NOTE:
This was not part of the 'short-form' questionnaire; for short-form 
panel cases, however, 1990 study data were incorporated.

QUESTION:
---------
In addition to being an American what do you consider your main
ethnic group or nationality group?
(IF MORE THAN 1 GROUP MENTIONED:) With which of these groups do you
most closely identify?

VALID_CODES:
------------
010-874. Ethnicity as coded

MISSING_CODES:
--------------
877. 'American'; 'Just American'; none; neither 
     (response to 'choice' question); NA
888. DK
000. Short-form 'new' Cross Section (1992)
Inap. question not used

NOTES:
------
See ethnicicty codes- Appendix "ETHNICITY"
GENERAL NOTE:
This represents the single mention of respondents who indicated only
1 ethnic group and the 'most close' group (followup question) of
respondents who indicated more than 1 ethnic group.
There is no code to single out Rs who volunteered to assert their
'American' identity.  This is because in most years these Rs were
combined with NA and/or 'none' (no ethnic identity).
1978 NOTE:
A version of this question which included a (filter) lead-in was used:  
'In addition to being an American, is there another nationality group 
or ethnic group that you feel you belong to?   [IF YES]  What...'   
Because of this format, the 1978 distributions varied dramatically from 
other years, and 1978 data have not been included.
1992 NOTE:
This was not part of the 'short-form' questionnaire; for short-form 
panel cases, however, 1990 study data were incorporated.
1994 NOTE:
For panel cases, 1992 data were incorporated.
1996 NOTE:
In a few cases R identified 2 or more nationality/ethnicity groups but 
the interviewer did not ask the 'choice' followup (due to incorrect 
completion of the IWR checkpoint); since R's chosen nationality/
ethnicity remained undetermined, these cases (30) were considered 
missing data (code 99 here).
2004 NOTE:
For respondents who gave multiple mentions but did not choose one
ethnic group as closest, 1st mention is coded.
2008 NOTE:
For respondents who gave multiple mentions but did not choose one
ethnic group as closest, 1st mention is coded.

About what do you think your total income will be this year for yourself 
and your immediate family.  Just give me the number/ letter) of the 
right income category.
1966,1970:  
Many people don't know their exact (1966/1970) income yet; but would you

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
See Appendix "INCOME" for income ranges corresponding to these 
percentiles.
Study coding of income was approximated as closely as possible to fit 
within this version.  Prior to 1972, this was an estimate of CURRENT 
year's income; since 1972, PREVIOUS year's income.  Note that in all 
years beginning 1976 this question was not actually asked if R was the 
only household member age 14 or over: in such cases, data from the 
question asking R's own income was duplicated. (Prior to 1976 R's 
own income was not determined.)
Beginning in 1964, R was shown a respondent card or booklet.
1948 NOTE:
Question wording was undocumented.
1960 NOTE:
Personal data forms were completed for no-pre cases: data from
these forms were incorporated.
1996 NOTE:
For 14 cases, interviewers entered responses where individual income 
was higher than family income.  In some of these cases, the responses 
for family income and R income may have been provided.entered in
incorrect order.
1998 NOTE:
Some interviewers coded lowest income category when the respondent 
stated that he or she did not know what the household income was.  
Study staff has reviewed all interviewer comment material available to 
identify cases coded in the lowest category where comment notes clearly 
indicate Don't Know; such cases have been recoded to DK.  However, it 
is not known whether there are additional DK cases (without recorded 
comments) for which lowest category had been incorrectly coded.
2002 NOTE:
Income categories were too broad for approximation here.

within the occupation codes from which this variable has been
recoded. For years prior to 1972, this is respondent self- 
identification (exceptions described in the appendix for cases where R 
described self as working student or homemaker).
For years 1972 and later except 2002 fresh cross, this is occupation 
status after the respondent has first self-identified in one or more 
occupation categories and then has answered other employment questions 
related to work history, number of  work hours etc.; for these years, 
it may be that coding here differs from R's initial self-

people from attending religious services even if they want to.
Thinking about your life these days, do you ever attend religious
services, apart from occasional weddings, baptisms or funerals?'
(SEE VCF0130), which had some effect on distributions.
This has been collapsed from the Study variable summarizing R's 
religious self-identification, constructed from the complete set of
questions asked, usually including questions additional to those 
documented here (see VCF0129).
1948 NOTE:
Question wording was undocumented.
1992 NOTE:
This question was not part of the 'short-form' questionnaire; for short-
form panel cases, however, 1990 study data were incorporated.
1994 NOTE:
For panel cases, 1992 data were incorporated.
2002 NOTE:
For panel cases, 2000 data were incorporated.

NOTES:

See Appendix "2002 RELIGION NOTE".  
See also VCF0152.
GENERAL NOTE:
These questions follow up questions in VCF0128.
The addition in 1972 of "Is that Southern Baptist or something else?" 
significantly changed distributions of Protestant Baptists beginning in 
that year.
Beginning in 1990 (except 2002), the full set of religion codes was 
expanded considerably, adding codes for different affiliations within 
the major mainline Protestant denominations and reworking almost
entirely the Pentecostal, Holiness, fundamentalist, and evangelical
Protestant denominations.  VCF0152 gives the 'new' set of full
codes.
2002 NOTE:
2000 data were included in the 2002 study religion summary variable by 
recoding from the 2000 study variable, which differed somewhat in 
coding from that used for 2002 fresh cross-section cases.  A 
description of the recode from the 2002 summary variable is provided in 
the Appendix.

to (church/synagogue) every week, almost every week, once or twice a
month, a few times a year, or never?
1990 AND LATER:  Lots of things come up that keep people from
attending religious services even if they want to.  Thinking about
your life these days, do you ever attend religious services, apart
from occasional weddings, baptisms or funerals?  (IF YES:) Do you go

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
Beginning in 1990, question flow was reversed so that the religious
attendance question preceded religious affiliation questions, whereas 
in previous studies religious attendance followed.  Beginning in 1990, 
frequency of religious attendance was preceded by a general attendance 
filter (yes/no); a "no" response to the filter 1990 and later has been 
coded 5 here.
1970 NOTE:
Only codes corresponding to VCF0130 codes 2-5 were used (no code for 
"every week"). "Almost every week" from 1970 has been recoded to 1, 
with no 1970 cases appearing in code 2.
1992 NOTE:
This question was not part of the 'short-form' questionnaire; for short-
form panel cases, however, 1990 study data were incorporated.

1958 NOTE:
To reconcile  the original 1958 Study data, Rs who did not grow up in 
the U.S. (and who were not asked this question) were coded into 
generalized foreign codes, e.g., 'Central America,' 'Eastern Europe,' 
etc., based upon parents' foreign origins according to information 
obtained in questions about places of mother's and father's birth 
(VCF0144,VCF0145).

GENERAL NOTE:
In 1956-1964, the named community was coded according to its 
approximate population at the time R was growing up.  A community may 
thus have been coded for the study  into a size category different from 
the size description chosen by R in his/her answer.  "City" categories 
by population during these years were (in general): under 10,000;  
10,000-50,000; 100,000-250,000;  250,000+.  For the codes here, the 
250,000+ category was  placed into "large city", while lesser-
population cities were included in code 3.
In 1966-1976, R's own perception of size of community was used.

Data 1978-2004 are from the household listing. For years 1958-1968
and 2008, these data are from questions in the demographic section
of the interview.  It is unknown how 1956 data were obtained.
1970 NOTE:
The respondent was not asked how many children were in the household 
if R had no children of his/her own (or MD if had any). 1970 data are 
therefore not included.
1994 NOTE:
R was asked if he/she had any children of his/her own; number of 
children in the household was not established. 1994 data are therefore
not included.
2000 NOTE:
same as 1994.
2002 NOTE:
These data are available only for 2002 fresh cross-section cases.
2008 NOTE:
A count of children was obtained in the household listing as well as
in the demographic section of the Pre-election interview. This 
represents demographic section data.

GENERAL NOTE:
All codes within United States have been recoded to 199.
This question was a follow-up to VCF0143.  If R responded "yes" to
VCF0143, then VCF0144 and VCF0145 have been coded 199.
Black Rs were not asked this question in 1960, 1964, 1966, 1968 or
1970 and for these years have been recoded to code 199, United States.  
Parents of foreign-born Rs were also present in missing data during 
these years in the study datasets, but for this variable parental 
birthplaces have been imputed from R's own birth-place, as a
generalized category e.g., "British  Isles" if R were born in England).

Personal data forms were completed for no-pre cases:  data from these

GENERAL NOTE:
Common law partners first appeared as a volunteered code in 1964.  
Interviewer instruction 1990 and later:  'If spouse is in a nursing
home or works in another city, or the family is in the process of
moving and is temporarily holding 2 residences, code 1 is used.'
1952 NOTE:
Rs who were not married have been recoded to NA because their specific 
status as divorced, widowed, never married etc. was not determined.  Rs 
married at the time of the 1952 interview have all been coded 1 in 
VCF0147, with no 1952 cases appearing in codes 2-7.
1960 NOTE:
1960 pre variable was used except for 22 no-pre cases, for which post 
marital status was used.
1986 NOTE:
Unmarried Rs were directly asked if they were living with a partner.
1992 NOTE:
This question was not part of the 'short-form' questionnaire; for short-
form panel cases, however, 1990 study data were incorporated, except in 
cases where additional information current to 1992 [as determined by the
interviewer] contradicted the marital status of 1990.  In the latter
instances, the 1992 marital status variable was coded to reflect the
most complete and up-to-date information known by the interviewer.
2002 NOTE:
For panel cases, 2000 data were included.
2008 NOTE:
This question was asked in 2 versions; data are combined in this 
variable.

GENERAL NOTE:
In 1980, those who were "permanently disabled" when the occupation 
questions began but who subsequently replied that they were also 
currently working were not administered the "permanently disabled" 
series (past employment, if any) but instead were administered the 
"working now" set of questions (present employment), regardless of 
number of hours working [code 10].  Code 60 only represents nonworking 
disabled (during all years since 1980).
2002 NOTE:
Number of hours working was not determined; no 2002 data.

        GROUP THERMOMETER INTRO
=============================================================================

1964-1968:
There are many groups in America that try to get the government or the
American people to see things more their way.  We would like to get
your feelings towards some of these groups.  I have here a card on
which there is something that looks like a thermometer.  We call it a
"feeling thermometer" because it measures your feelings towards
groups. Here's how it works. If you don't know too much about a group
or don't feel particularly warm or cold toward them, then you should
place them in the middle, at the 50 degree mark.  If you have a warm
feeling toward a group or feel favorably toward it, you would give it
a score somewhere between 50 degrees and 100 degrees, depending on how
warm your feeling is toward the group.  On the other hand, if you
don't feel very favorably toward some of these groups--if there are
some you don't care for too much--then you would place them somewhere
between 0 degrees and 50 degrees.
1970-1974:
(1970: As you know, there are many groups and persons in America that
try to get the government or the American people to see things more
their way. Please use the thermometer again--this time to indicate
your feelings toward these groups or persons.)  (1972,1974: We'd also
like to get your feelings about some groups in American society, using
the feeling thermometer just as we did for the [1972: candidates;
1974: leaders]. If we come to a group you don't know much about, just
tell me and we'll move on to the next one.)  
1976:  
We'd also like to get your feelings about some groups in American 
society.  When I read the name of a group, we'd like you to rate it with 
what we call a feeling thermometer.  Ratings between 50 degrees-100 
degrees mean that you feel favorably and warm toward the group; ratings 
between 0 and 50 degrees mean that you don't feel favorably towards the 
group and that you don't care too much for that group.  If you don't 
feel particularly warm or cold toward a group you would rate them at 50 
degrees.  If we come to a group you don't know much about, just tell me 
and we'll move on to the next one.
1978-1984:  
(1980-1984: And still using the thermometer, how would you rate the 
following.)  
1986-LATER:  
([And] still using the thermometer, how would you rate [the following]:)

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE FOR ALL GROUP THERMOMETERS:
Card or respondent booklet shown to R exc. 2000 telephone, 2002.
In all Pre-Post study years except 1968 and 1976, group thermometers
followed (within the same wave, if not immediately) the series of 
thermometers for specific political figures, so that R was asked to 
recall the "explanation" of the thermometer.  In 1968 and 1976 only, 
group thermometers appeared in a separate wave.
1964 NOTE:
"Don't knows" were coded 50 on thermometers; groups about which the 
respondent "didn't know much" were also placed at 50 degrees
1966 NOTE:
same as 1964.
1968 NOTE:
same as 1964.
1970 NOTE:
The  order in which group thermometers were asked varied by form.
1970-1976 NOTE:
The respondent was not asked to give thermometer ratings for groups 
about which R "didn't know much" or "didn't know too much."  However, 
it is unclear whether such cases were coded DK or NA.
1996 NOTE:
Group thermometers were administered in random order.
1998 NOTE:
same as 1996.
2000 NOTE:
same as 1996.
2002 NOTE:
Group thermometers were randomly assigned to one of two possible 
orderings.
2004 note:
same as 1996.
2008 note:
same as 1996

SPECIAL NOTE:
As much as possible, this variable has been coded according 
to a new algorithm that was introduced in the December 9, 
2009 ANES memo: "Clarification of apolitical codes in the 
party identification summary variable on ANES datasets"   
(http://electionstudies.org/announce/newsltr/20091208PartyID.pdf)  .
The difference in construction between versions of the 
party ID summary variable in this file (VCF0301 and VCF0301x)
affects a very small proportion of respondents.
For years prior to 1972, a party ID summary variable was 
present in Time Series release datasets unaccompanied by 
the variables used in its construction, so that the new 
algorithm could not be followed for those years (however, 
cases coded as apolitical in the original summary variable 
are coded to 0 in VCF0301).
Researchers should note that the individual Time Series 
files up to and including the 2004 Time Series Study do 
not include new this version of the a party ID summary 
variable.
GENERAL NOTE:
As much as possible, this has been coded according to 
the prescribed algorithm in the December 9, 2009 ANES memo, 
"Clarification of apolitical codes in the party 
identification summary variable on ANES datasets."
For years prior to 1972, however, only a summary variable
was available in the Time Series release dataset so
that the algorithm could not be followed (however, cases
coded as apolitical in the summary variable are coded
to 0 in VCF0301).

NOTES:

GENERAL NOTE:
A new algorithm for construction of a party ID summary variable 
was introduced in the December 9, 2009 ANES memo: "Clarification 
of apolitical codes in the party identification summary variable 
on ANES datasets."  
(http://electionstudies.org/announce/newsltr/20091208PartyID.pdf) . 
The new algorithm was used in the creation of CDF variable VCF0301 
and for the creation of the summary variable included for the 2008 
Time Series Study. 2008 Time Series data are not represented in 
VCF0301x.
APOLITICAL Code 9: In 1952-1966, an R who voluntarily specified complete
disinterest in politics ('I never vote,' 'I don't get involved in 
politics,' etc.) in response to party identification was coded as 
apolitical.  S/he was not then asked if s/he felt closer to either 
major party. In 1968-1980, 1984 an R who responded 'no preference'
to party identification and who responded with 'neither', DK or NA when 
asked if s/he felt closer to either major party was coded as apolitical 
if s/he otherwise also expressed a general disinterest in politics.
In 1982, 1986 and later, an R who expressed 'no preference' for party 
identification and who responded with 'neither,' DK or NA when asked if 
s/he felt closer to either major party was coded as apolitical IF s/he
also indicated little or no interest in politics in response to 
questions corresponding VCF0310, VCF0311/VCF0312, VCF0313, VCF0702).
INDEPENDENT - Code 4: In 1952-1966, an R was defined as independent if 
s/he responded 'independent' to party identification and then responded 
with 'neither,' DK or NA when asked if s/he felt closer to either major 
party. In 1968-1980 and 1984 an R was defined as independent (code 4 in 
VCF0301) if s/he responded 'independent' to party identification and 
then responded with 'neither,' DK or NA when asked if s/he felt closer 
to either major party.  An R was also defined as independent (code 4 in
VCF0301) if:  #1. s/he responded 'no preference' to party 
identification  AND #2. responded with 'neither,' DK or NA when asked 
if s/he felt closer to either major party AND #3. if s/he otherwise 
expressed some interest in politics.
INDEPENDENT/APOLITICAL - Codes 4/9: In 1982, 1986 and later,  an R who 
responded 'independent' to party identification and who then responded 
with 'neither,' DK or NA when asked if s/he felt closer to either major 
party was coded as independent (code 4 in VCF0301).  An R who expressed 
'no preference' for party identification and who responded with 
'neither,' DK or NA when asked if s/he felt closer to either major 
party was coded as independent (code 4 in VCF0301) IF s/he also 
indicated some interest in politics in response to the 4 questions 
listed above.
OTHER - Code 0: In all years, if an R responded to the party 
identification question with the mention of a minor party and then 
responded 'neither,' DK or NA when asked if s/he felt closer to either 
major party, then s/he has been coded "other."
LEANERS - Codes 3,5: 'Leaners' have included (all years): A. Rs who 
responded 'independent' to party identification and who responded with 
the mention of a major party when asked if s/he felt closer to either 
major party; B. Rs who responded to the party identification question 
with the mention of a minor party but who said they felt closer to one 
major party; C. Rs who responded to the party identification with 'no 
preference' but who said they felt closer to one major party.

        POLITICAL FIGURE THERMOMETER INTRO
=============================================================================

1968-1974:  
(1968,1972: As you know, there were many people mentioned this past year 
as possible  candidates for President [1972: or Vice-President] by the 
political parties.)  
(1970: Several political leaders have already been mentioned as possible 
candidates for President in 1972.)  
(1968-1972: We would like to get your feelings toward some of these 
people.) 
(1974: Now I'd like to get your feelings toward some of our political 
leaders and other people who are in the news these days.)
I have here a card on which there is something that looks like a 
thermometer.  We call it a "feeling thermometer" because it measures  
your feelings toward these people. (1968: You probably remember that we 
used something like this in our earlier interview with you.) 
Here's how it works.  If you don't feel particularly warm or cold toward 
a person, then you should place him in the middle of the thermometer, at 
the 50 degree mark.  If you have a warm feeling toward him or feel 
favorably toward him, you would give him a score somewhere between 50 
degrees and  100 degrees. (1968-1970 only: depending on how warm your 
feeling is toward that person).  On the other hand, if you don't feel 
very favorably toward a person--that is, if you don't care for him too 
much--then you would place him somewhere between 0 degrees and 50 
degrees. Of course, if you don't know too much about a person, just tell 
me and we'll go on to the next name.
1976:
As you know, many people were mentioned this year as possible candidates 
for president or vice-president by the political parties.  We would like 
to get your feelings toward some of these people. 
I'll read the name of each person and I'd like you to rate that person 
with what we call a feeling thermometer. Ratings between 50 and 100 
degrees mean that you feel favorably and warm toward the person, ratings 
between 0 and 50 degrees mean that you don't feel favorably towards the 
person and that you don't care too much for that person.  If you don't 
feel particularly warm or cold toward a person you would rate them at 50 
degrees.  If we come to a person you don't know much about, just tell me 
and we'll move on to the next one.
1978-LATER:  
I'd like to get your feelings toward some of our political leaders and 
other people who are in the news these days (1990: have been in the 
news).  I'll read the name of a person and I'd like you to rate that 
person using (1986-LATER: something we call) the feeling thermometer.  
Ratings between 50 and 100 (1986-LATER: degrees) mean that you feel 
favorably and warm toward the person; ratings between 0 and 50 degrees 
mean that you don't feel favorably toward the person and that you don't 
care too much for that person.  (1986-LATER: You would rate the person 
at the 50 degree mark if you don't feel particularly warm or cold toward 
the person.) If we come to a person whose name you don't recognize, you 
don't need to rate that person.  Just tell me and we'll move on to the 
next one. (1978-1984: If you do recognize the name, but you don't feel 
particularly warm or cold toward the person, then you would rate the 
person at the 50 degree mark.)

NOTES:
------
GENERAL  NOTE:
For study years where the same thermometer appeared in both the Pre and 
Post, the Pre data are used.
1968 NOTE:
"Don't know"s were coded 50 on thermometers; groups about which the 
respondent "didn't know much" were also placed at 50 degrees. The 50 
degree mark was labeled "50 degrees; no feeling".
1970 NOTE:
The order of names read varied by form.
1996 NOTE:
The order of thermometers for all individuals except Presidential 
candidates was randomized.  
1998 NOTE:
The order of thermometers for all individuals except the President
(first thermometer) was randomized.
2000 NOTE:
same as 1998
2002 NOTE:
Individual thermometers were administered in one of two possible 
orders, following President (first thermometer).
2004 NOTE:
The order of thermometers for all individuals except the president
(first thermometer) and Ronald Reagan, in retrospect (as the last/
14th thermometer) was randomized.  Overall randomization was devised
as a set of consecutive subrandomizations; major presidental candidates
thermometers other than then incumbent president were randomly
administered as the 2nd-3rd names, follwed by other political figures 
as the 4th-11th randomized thermometers.  Thermometers for the major
parties were randomly administered in the 12th-13th positions.

would you consider yourself a liberal or a conservative?" [VCF0849]),
then R was not asked for party placements on this scale.

QUESTION:
---------
1988 FORM A, 1990 AND LATER:  Some people feel that the government in
Washington should make every possible effort to improve the social
and economic position of blacks. Others feel that the government

Washington should make every possible effort to improve the social and
economic position of blacks (1970: Negroes) and other minority groups
(1980: even if it means giving them preferential treatment).  Others
feel that the government should not make any special effort to help
minorities because they should help themselves (1970: but they should
be expected to help themselves).

that R did have an interest/opinion BUT responded "DK" or NA when
asked for that opinion, then R was not asked this question.
In 1988,1992,2000, among Rs who indicated that they had an opinion on
this issue, Respondents who were asked this question were limited to
Rs having their own opinions as one of the following: 1) The government
is too powerful; OR 2) The government is not getting too strong AND 
(followup) the government should become more powerful.
1992 NOTE:
46 cases were not asked this question due to an error in skip

VCF0702        Did R Vote in the November Elections
=============================================================================

QUESTION:
---------
1948: 
In the election, about half the people voted and about half of
them didn't.  Did you vote?
1962: 
One of the things we need to know is whether or not people really did 
get to vote this fall.  In talking to people about the election we find 
that a lot of people weren't able to vote because they weren't 
registered or they were sick or something else came up at the last 
minute.  Do you remember for sure whether or not you voted in the 
November election?
1952-1960,1964-1998, 2002 VERSION 1, and 2004 VERSION 1:  
In talking to people about the election we (1972 AND LATER: often) find 
that a lot of people weren't able to vote because they weren't 
registered or they were sick or they just didn't have time. (1956-1960: 
How about you, did you vote this time?)  (1964-1970: How about you, did 
you vote this time, or did something keep you from voting) (1972-1976: 
How about you, did you vote in the elections this fall?) (1978 and 
later: How about you, did you vote in the elections this November?)
2000, 2002 VERSION2, 2004 VERSION 2, 2008 VERSION 'OLD': 
In talking to people about elections, we often find that a lot of people 
were not able to vote because they weren't registered, they were sick, 
or they just didn't have time.  Which of the following statements best 
describes you:
  One, I did not vote (in the election this November);
  Two, I thought about voting this time - but didn't;
  Three, I usually vote, but didn't this time; or
  Four, I am sure I voted?
2008 VERSON 'NEW': 
Which one of the following best describes what you did in the 
elections that were held November 4th?
  1. Definitely did not vote in the elections
  2. Definitely voted in person at a polling place on election day
  3. Definitely voted in person at a polling place before election day
  4. Definitely voted by mailing a ballot to elections officials 
     before the election
  5. Definitely voted in some other way
  6. Not completely sure whether you voted or not
(IF NOT COMPLETELY SURE:) If you had to guess, would you say that you 
probably did vote in the elections, or probably did not vote in the 
elections?

------------
1.  No, did not vote
2.  Yes, voted

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
Code 2 includes 8 respondents from 1958, 8 respondents from 1962 and
14 respondents from 1968, who replied "yes, I think so."  
1956 NOTE:
Code 2 includes 3 cases from:  "Nonvoter, NA preference; voted, but not 
for president".
1982 NOTE:
For congressional districts GA04 and GA05, an additional question 
appeared:  How about the special US Congressional elections held 
November 30th.  Did you vote in that election?  From 1982, code 2
includes all GA04, GA05 respondents who voted in either the November 2
general election or the November 30 special election, or both.
2002 NOTE:
Respondents were randomly assigned to either version 1 or version 2.

NOTES:

GENERAL NOTE:
Derived from: vote variable VCF0702 and registration variable 
VCF0701/VCF0737 (VCF0701 pre-election data for 1952-1976,1980; VCF0737
post-election data for 1978, 1982-later; for 1952 cases without pre-
election interviews, post-election data from VCF0737).
All respondents who reported voting have been coded 3, regardless of
whether they actually reported being registered.  
No registration variable at all was present in 1958,1962,1966,1970 or 
1974.
In some years a few respondents have declared that registration was not 
required in their state; these cases have been included with 
'registered'.
2004 NOTE:
This is a summary variable of vote and registration status.

NOTES:
------
See also VCF0735,VCF0736,VCF1011-VCF1013
GENERAL NOTE:
The Ballot Card was introduced in 1978.
Note that VCF0707 and VCF0736 differ slightly from VCF1011-VCF1013 for
years prior to 1978: see VCF1011.
1952-1968:  When an 'incorrect' name--i.e., not on the list of 
candidates which the interviewer had for R's congressional district--
was given with a party association, the party given was coded and is 
represented here.  When a 'correct' name was given with an incorrect 
party, however, the actual party associated with the named candidate 
was coded in Study data: "Smith, a Democrat" was coded as a Republican 
if, in fact Smith was a Republican.  [In 1952-1968, party was asked for 
only if R did not know the candidate name or gave an 'incorrect' name.  
If R correctly named a candidate for his/her district without 
volunteering party association, party was not asked for, and factual 
party of candidate was coded.]  In 1958 ONLY, if the respondent gave 
the correct name of a candidate from another race in R's district, then 
R was informed of the named candidate's actual race and the question 
for R's House vote was repeated.
In 1952, 1956, 1958, 1960, and 1964 this question was coded as a
multiple response allowing, when applicable, for candidate-at-large
mentions (2nd response) as well as district choice of candidates (1st
response).  Second responses were excluded in coding VCF0707.
1970-1976:  R's perception of candidate's party was coded.  If not 
volunteered, party of candidate was always asked for.  If party 
associated by R was not the actual party of a correctly named 
candidate, party as mentioned was still coded. Even if an 'incorrect' 
name (i.e., name not on the interviewer's list of candidate names--see 
VCF1006 for description of lists) was given, party associated by R was 
coded.
Ballot card 1978-1982, 1984 personal, 1986 and later: when R gave a 
name not on the ballot card, the party of actual vote remained 
undeterminable (0 in VCF0707), unless R voted outside district of 
interview and R's major party vote from 'outside' district could be 
established (if a recognizable name was given).
No ballot card 1980-later:  Respondents who had voted outside the 
Congressional District of their sample selection location could not use 
the Ballot Card, and question wording was altered somewhat. 1980 was 
the first year that cases of 'outside' Congressional District voting 
were identified.
1984 NOTE:
In Post telephone interviews, If the interviewer had the correct Ballot 
Card at hand, then he or she attempted to read the names and party 
affiliations of the House candidates [see question wording above].  
1992 NOTE:
In telephone interviews, names were not read by the interviewer, but 
attempt was made, in many cases, to leave ballot cards with respondents 
if a telephone appointment was made. 
1994 NOTE:
A 'ballot card' experiment was conducted; see VCF0012.
1996 NOTE:
same as 1992
2000 NOTE:
For respondents registered in county of interview, the order of 
candidate names was randomized on the Ballot Card/as read by 
interviewers.
2002 NOTE:
For respondents registered in county of interview, the order of 
candidate names was randomized as read by interviewers.

NOTES:
------
SEE VCF0707 (Senate data coded in same manner as House data).
GENERAL NOTE:
1980-later cases administered without Ballot Card presentation include
respondents who had voted outside the state of their sample selection
location. 1980 was the first year that 'outside' voting was identified.
In California in 1992, in Tennessee in 1994, and in Kansas in 1996 the
regular Senate election and a second "special" Senate election were
held.  This variable codes data for the respondent's vote in the
regular Senate election only.  [Note special question wording was not
used for Tennessee in 1994].
2002 NOTE:
For respondents registered in county of interview, the order of 
candidate names was randomized in text read by telephone interviewers.

QUESTION:
---------
ALL YEARS EXC. 1948,1992:  
Who do you think you will vote for in the election for President?
1948:  
On the coming Presidential election, do you plan to vote? (IF RESPONSE 
NOT 'NO':)  Do you plan to vote Republican, Democrat or something else?
1992 and 1996: 
We all know the election is some time away and people are not certain at 
this point who they will vote for. Still, who do you think you will vote 
for in the election for President?

VALID_CODES:
------------
1.  Democratic candidate (with or without qualifications,
      1952-1976)
2.  Republican candidate (with or without qualifications,
      1952-1976)
3.  Undecided; DK (except 1964)
4.  R does not intend to vote (incl. "no, qualified" if

Inap. question not used

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
This is a pre var.
For 1952-1976, codes 1 and 3 also include presidential candidate vote 
intentions "with qualifications."   Codes for candidate vote intention 
"with qualifications" did not appear after 1976.
In 1952-1976, if R's response to the question "As far as you know, do
you expect to vote in the elections this November?" was "yes, 
qualified" (think so/ guess so/ probably, etc.), R was asked this
question; if R's response was "no, qualified" (probably not,  etc.) 
R has been included in code 4; if R's response was "pro-con," then 
this has been coded 0.
After 1976, no codes appeared for "yes, qualified," "no, qualified,"
or "pro-con".

NOTES:
------
1962 NOTE:
"Split ticket, mostly 'other' party" was combined in study data with
"split ticket, NA how split."  Because of the very small number of 
cases voting mostly or entirely for a 3rd/minor party, this combination 
category was recoded to 3.
1958 NOTE:
If R voted Democratic or Republican with only 1 exception, then R
was coded as 'straight ticket.'

=============================================================================

QUESTION:
---------
1952,1956,1960,1964,1968,1972,1976:  
We're (1952: mainly) interested in this interview in finding out whether 
people paid much attention to the election campaign this year.  Take 
newspapers for instance--did you read (1972 ONLY: much) about the 
campaign in any newspaper?
1974: 
(IF R READS A DAILY NEWSPAPER:) Did you read anything about the campaign 
this year in any newspaper?
1978-1986,1990: 
Did you read about the campaign in any newspapers?
1988,1992 AND LATER: 
(IF R HAS READ A DAILY NEWSPAPER IN THE PAST WEEK:) Did you read about 
the campaign in any newspaper?

VALID_CODES:
------------
1.  No, read no newspapers about the campaign
2.  Yes, read newspaper(s) about the campaign

Inap. question not used

NOTES:
------
See VCF0724.
GENERAL NOTE:
In 1974, 1988 and 1992, this question was preceded by a filter. The
1974 filter was:  Do you read a daily newspaper?  In 1988 and 1992 the
filter was:  How many days in the past week did you read a daily
paper?  Rs who replied "no" [1974] or "none" [1988] to the filter
question were not asked this question.  However, 1974 Rs who replied
"no" have been coded 1 while 1988 and 1992 Rs who replied "none" have
been coded 0.
In some years, this question was accompanied by a follow-up question
which asked how much/how often R read campaign articles, how many
campaign articles R read, or how much attention R paid to campaign
articles. If the respondent had read articles at all, regardless how 
little, then R has been coded 2.  Several 1986, 1990, 1992, and 1996
respondents who replied "yes" to the main question, but who replied in
the followup question that they paid "no attention" to articles, have
still been coded 2.  From the 1980 and 1984 studies, however, several
respondents who answered "yes" to the main question but who then
volunteered in the followup that they read "no" articles have been
coded 1 rather than 2.  The 1974 and 1978 follow-up questions have
been disregarded.
1972 NOTE:
Addition of "much" to wording affected distributions significantly.

GENERAL NOTE:
1980 was the first year that 'outside' Congressional District voting 
was identified.
Codes 81-92 first appeared in 1980 study data (not in 1978 data).
1992 and later:  Code 97 includes cases where R volunteered that
he/she voted "a straight ticket" but no candidate for R's party ran;
it also includes cases where R insists that he/she voted for a
specific party's candidate but no candidate from that party ran in R's
district.  For Rs who voted outside district of interview location,
code 97 also includes candidates named by R but whose CD and party are
not known.  It also includes cases where R names a candidate but the
name is not among names of candidates within a known 'outside' CD.

NOTES:

GENERAL NOTE:
This index is constructed from the thermometer score for liberals
(VCF0211) and the thermometer score for conservatives (VCF0212).
The calculation used is the following:  First, the value of VCF0211 is
subtracted from 97, and that difference is added to the value of
VCF0212.  This sum is then divided by 2, and .5 is added to the
result.  Finally, the solution is truncated to obtain an integer
value.  If either VCF0211 or VCF0212 is 98, then VCF0801 is coded 98;
99 is coded in VCF0801 if it is the only missing data value coded
in VCF0211,VCF0212.

ALL YEARS EXC. 2000 TELEPHONE,2002:
We hear a lot of talk these days about liberals and conservatives.  Here 
is (1972,1974: I'm going to show you) a 7-point scale on which the 
political views that people might hold are arranged from extremely 
liberal to extremely conservative.
Where would you place yourself on this scale, or haven't you thought
much about this?  (7-POINT SCALE SHOWN TO R)
2000 TELEPHONE: 
When it comes to politics, do you usually think of yourself as extremely 
liberal, liberal, slightly liberal, moderate or middle of the road, 
slightly conservative, extremely conservative, or haven't you thought 
much about this?

GENERAL NOTE:
For years 1984 and later, a follow-up 'choice' question was asked of 
respondents who replied "don't know" or "haven't thought much" to this 
question; except for years 1984, 1986 and 1990 this follow-up 'choice' 
question was also asked of respondents who answered "moderate."  For 
these years, a final 3-category summary was constructed:  the 'choice' 
question is found in VCF0824; the final 3-category summary is VCF0849.
2000 NOTE:
This variable represents 7-point scale data from interviews conducted 
using both modes (telephone and personal).
In addition to the traditional 7-point scale version of this question, 
approximately half of the 2000 Study respondents (both modes) were 
instead randomly selected for administration of a branching series.

or not?  (IF YES:) Do you agree that the government should do this or do 
you think the government should not do it.

Some say the government in Washington ought to help people get doctors

QUESTION:
---------
There is much concern about the rapid rise in medical and hospital
costs.  Some (1988,1994-LATER: people) feel there should be a
government insurance plan which would cover all medical and hospital
expenses (1984 AND LATER: for everyone).  (1996,2004: Suppose these
people are at one end of a scale, at point 1). Others feel that 
(1988,1994-1996: all) medical expenses should be paid by individuals, 
and through private insurance (1984 AND LATER: plans) like Blue Cross 
(1984-1994: or [1996:some] other company paid plans). (1996,2004:
Suppose these people are at the other end, at point 7.  And of course, 
some people have opinions somewhere in between at points 2,3,4,5 or 6.)

VCF0817        R Placement: School Busing Scale
=============================================================================

QUESTION:
---------
There is much discussion about the best way to deal with racial
problems.  Some people think achieving racial integration of schools
is so important that it justifies busing children to schools out of
their own neighborhoods.  Others think letting children go to their
neighborhood schools is so important that they oppose busing.
Where would you place yourself on this scale, or haven't you thought
much about this?  (7-POINT SCALE SHOWN TO R)

QUESTION:
---------
We hear a lot of talk these days about liberals and conservatives.
Here is (1972,1974: I'm going to show you) a 7-point scale on which
the political views that people might hold are arranged from extremely
liberal to extremely conservative.  Where would you place yourself on
this scale, or haven't you thought much about this? (7-POINT SCALE
SHOWN TO R).
(IF R RESPONDS "DON'T KNOW" OR "HAVEN'T THOUGHT MUCH ABOUT THIS" IN
1984 AND LATER; IF R RESPONDS "MODERATE" IN 1988,1992,1996-LATER:)
If you had to choose, would you consider yourself a liberal or a
conservative?

NOTES:

GENERAL NOTE:
This is the  follow-up 'choice' question asked 1984 and later of Rs 
who replied to the full 7-point scale question (VCF0803) with "Don't 
know" or "haven't thought much"; except for years 1984, 1986 and 1990 
this question was also asked of Respondents who answered "moderate."
Using the initial 7-point scale (VCF0803) and this follow-up, a final 
3-category summary was also constructed in these years: the final 3-
category summary is VCF0849.
If R's response to the 7-point scale question (VCF0803) was NA then
this follow-up question was not asked.
2000 NOTE:
This variable represents 7-point scale data from interviews conducted 
using both modes; approximately half of the 2000 Study respondents (both
modes) were randomly selected for administration of a branching 
series.  The latter respondents are excluded here.

(1968,1970: There is much talk about "hawks" and "doves" in connection

Some people think we should do everything necessary to win a complete

VCF0849        Summary: Liberal-Conservative Position of R
=============================================================================

QUESTION:
---------
We hear a lot of talk these days about liberals and conservatives. I'm
going to show you [1996-LATER: Here is] a 7-point scale on which the
political views that people might hold are arranged from extremely
liberal to extremely conservative.  Where would you place yourself
on this scale, or haven't you thought much about this? (7-POINT SCALE
SHOWN TO R).
(IF R RESPONDS "DON'T KNOW" OR "HAVEN'T THOUGHT MUCH ABOUT THIS"In
1984 AND LATER; IF R RESPONDS "MODERATE" IN 1988, 1992, 1996-LATER:)
If you had to choose, would you consider yourself a liberal or a
conservative?

VALID_CODES:
------------
1.  Liberal
3.  Moderate ('middle of the road')
5.  Conservative
6.  Refuses to choose (in follow-up [exc. 1988
    moderates]), don't know

--------------
9.  NA to entire question
0.  NA to follow-up; R not administered 7pt scale
    series (2000); no Post IW

NOTES:
------
See also VCF0803 and VCF0824.
GENERAL NOTE:
This is the final 3-cateogry summary for years 1984 and later, 
constructed using the initial 7-point scale question (VCF0803) and the 
follow-up 'choice' question (VCF0824), which was asked of respondents 
who had replied "don't know" or "haven't thought much" to the 7-point 
scale question and, except for years 1984, 1986, AND 1990, also asked 
of respondents who had answered "moderate".
If R's response to the 7-point scale question was NA, then the follow-
up question ('if you had to choose...') was not asked and VCF0849 has 
been coded 9.  If DK/HTM in first question and the response to the 
follow-up was "don't know," VCF0849 has been coded 8.  If R refused to 
choose in the follow-up, VCF0848 has been coded 7. 
Code 1 is comprised of "extremely liberal," "liberal," and "slightly
liberal" responses to the 7-point scale question (codes 1-3 in VCF0803) 
and of "liberal" responses to the follow-up.
Code 3 for 1984,1986,1990 is comprised of Rs who replied "moderate" to 
the 7-point scale question (code 4 in VCF0803, with the follow-up not 
asked) and also of Rs who replied DK or "haven't thought much" to the 
7-point scale question and who then replied "moderate" to the follow-up.
For 1988, 1992, 1996 and later, code 3 is comprised of: 1) cases where 
R replied "moderate" to the 7-point scale question and then refused to 
choose another category or replied DK/NA to the follow-up; and 2) Rs 
who replied DK or 'haven't thought much' to the 7-point scale question 
and then replied "moderate" in the follow-up.
Code 5 is comprised of "extremely conservative," conservative," and
"slightly conservative" responses to the 7-point scale question (codes
5-7 in VCF0803) and of "conservative" responses in the follow-up.
2000 NOTE:
This variable represents 7-point scale follow-up data from interviews 
conducted using both modes; approximately half of the 2000 Study 
respondents (both modes) were randomly selected for administration of a 
branching series and are excluded here.

should try to take care of?
1970:  
As you well know, there are many serious problems in this country and in 
other parts of the world.  We'd like to start out by talking with you 
about some of them.  What do you personally feel are the most important 
problems which the government in Washington should try to take care of?
1972-1978,1984 AND LATER:  
What do you think are the most important problems facing this country?  
(IF MORE THAN ONE PROBLEM:) Of all you've told me (1996-LATER: Of those 
you've mentioned), what would you say is the single most important 
problem the country faces?

NOTES:
------
See Appendix note "MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEM".
GENERAL NOTE:
Because of changes in the full sets of codes which have been used over
time, this variable is limited to preserving the major groupings which
have been utilized with essential consistency through all years.  The
appendix note gives exact study-by-study versions of the texts of 
individual codes which have been collapsed to form the VCF0875 group 
categories.
In the 1960, 1966, and 1970 study datasets, one multiple- response 
variable was coded which included up to 3 mentions (1970: 4).  In 1960 
and 1970, variables were coded in order of importance in cases where R 
mentioned more than one problem. Within the study documentation for 
these two years, it was also stated that, in cases of more than one 
mentioned problem, if order of importance was 'not  clear,' responses 
were then coded in order of mention.  From the 1966 documentation, it 
is not apparent if multiple responses were coded in order of importance 
or if they were coded in order of mention.  The first CODED response 
(variable) in studies 1960, 1966, and 1970 has been used here. 
In the 1964 and 1968 study datasets, one single-response variable 
was coded.  This variable was described as including, in cases of more 
than one given response, the mention considered most important by R.  
Documentation in both years added that if order of importance was 'not 
clear,' responses were coded in order of mention:  in such event, the 
single variable appearing in the study dataset represented the first 
mention.
Note that, for cases where R mentioned two or three problems but
missing data (DK or NA) appeared in the 'choice' variable (i.e., R did 
not choose a single most important problem), the first mention has not 
been included here, but MD has been coded. EXCEPTION: in 1986, in 142 
cases the interviewer mistakenly did not ask R to rank problems by 
importance when R gave more than one mention.  In these 142 cases, the 
first mention of R has been incorporated.
In 1960, 1964 and 1966, the DK category was combined with "no issues"
and is included in code 00.
1996 NOTE:
A half-sample of respondents were selected to be administered this 
question.
2000 NOTE:
same as 1996.
2008 NOTE:
Revisions to 2008 master codes and coding procedures for open-ended 
questions will be completed at a future date.
Data coded according to new master codes will not be available until 
then.

GENERAL NOTE:
Weight variable VCF0010/VCF0010A must be used if
distributions including 1970 data are desired:  see VCF0010.
Note that use of VCF0010/VCF0010A as a weight reduces the
1970 total N for this variable:  form 2 whites who should appear as
code 0 INAP cases are excluded from the 1970 total N.
1992 NOTE:
This question was asked in both the pre and post; the pre data have

Codes 1-53 Plus:

MISSING_CODES:
--------------
98.  At large district
99.  District of Columbia
00.  NA; wrong district identified
Inap. question not used

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
Congressional district corresponds to the districting in effect during
the year of the interview, with the exception of California only for
1974: the redistricting occurring in California during 1974 was not
completed in time to be represented in the 1974 study.  District
numbers associated with 1974 California respondents are the district
numbers which were in effect in 1973.
Note that in some years several cases of corrections have been made to
states and/or Congressional districts due to inconsistencies or errors
in the STUDY data.
1992 NOTE 1:
For panel cases, this provides the congressional district of R's 
original address (1990) rather than that of the address at which R was 
residing in 1992.  Additionally, even if R did not move since 1990, the
redistricting which took place in many areas in 1992 may have changed
R'S district number in 1992.
1992 NOTE 2:
Late in 1994, it was discovered that in 50 cases an incorrect CD number 
had been assigned.  These errors affect all questions related to House 
race which are administered according to assigned-CD candidate names.  
In the introduction to this codebook (p. iv) is a listing of 1992 (pre) 
case IDs with correct congressional districts, however no data have 
been changed in this file as a result.  Users of CDF data can delete 
these cases from affected vars if desired.
1994 NOTE:
For panel cases who moved since their original, VCF0900 records the 
congressional district where R was interviewed for the current Study.  
The candidate list information also corresponds to the district where R 
was residing during the current Study interview.
1996 NOTE:
same as 1994.
2000 NOTE:  
3 cases were misidentified PA in the Preload but should have been NJ. 
These cases are coded 00.
2002 NOTE:
Preload district assignment was incorrect in 1 case.
2008 NOTE:
In 22 Post-election cases, the incorrect Congressional 
district was identified for the Respondent's location 
in the Post preload; in 1 case, the wrong Congressional 
district was identified for a case without a Post-election 
re-interview (case 1443).

See Appendix "STATE AND COUNTRY CODES".
GENERAL NOTE:
NES samples are not designed to be representative at the state level.  
Samples include cases from only some U.S. states; in many states only a 
small handful of interviews are taken.
1992 NOTE:
For panel cases, this provides the state of R's original address (when 
sample selection was made in 1990), rather than the state in which R 
was residing in 1992.
1994 NOTE:
For panel cases who moved since their original, VCF0900 records the 
congressional district where R was interviewed for the current Study.  
The candidate list information also corresponds to the district where R 
was residing during the current Study interview.
1996 NOTE:
same as 1994.
2000 NOTE:  
3 cases were misidentified PA in the Preload but should have been NJ. 
These cases are coded 00.
2004 NOTE:
This Is the ICPSR code for the state corresponding to the 
respondent's sampling address.

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:  
This variable is available for 1970, 1974 and 1976 as well as 1978 and 
later.  See warning note below.  In some years this variable is not
available for no-post cases.
NES samples are not designed to be representative at the Congressional 
district level.  Samples include cases from only some U.S. 
Congressional districts; for most congressional districts in which 
interviewing actually takes place, only a small number of interviews 
are taken.
Codes 40 and 49 apply as a result of redistricting: for other 
Cumulative Data File variables referent to "the incumbent" and "the 
challenger" the incumbent who represented R's sampling location BEFORE 
redistricting has been considered R's 'incumbent' and the other 
candidate (incumbent previously not representing R's sample location) 
has been considered the 'challenger'; if two incumbents ran against 
each other due to redistricting but neither had previously represented 
R's location,  neither candidate has been treated as an 'incumbent'.
1970,1974,1976 WARNING NOTE:  
In 1970, 1974 and 1976, no type of race var was present in the original 
NES datasets.  Data for these years have been added to VCF0902 by 
implementing a case-by-case determination of type of race for every R's 
congressional district through consultation of reference materials.  
The resultant data in VCF0902 for these years have been checked 
somewhat, but perfect accuracy cannot be guaranteed due to the nature 
of attempting case-by-case coding.  The type of race established in 
VCF0902 (and data in VCF0904-905 by derivation) for 1970, 1974 and 1976 
should be used with caution and at the user's risk.
1978 NOTE:
1978 data in this variable do not exactly match the 1978 Study data:
several congressional districts in 1978 were not accurately coded for
for type of House race.  MS03 was coded as 14 in the original 1978 data 
but should have been coded 12 (24 cases);  NY19 was coded as 12 in the 
original 1978 data but should have been coded 14 (9 cases);  NY38 was 
coded as 21 but should have been coded 24 (14 cases).  In VCF0902 these 
cases have been corrected.  However, note that in other Cumulative Data 
File 900s-series congressional vars except for VCF0904, VCF0905 and
VCF1004-1014,  candidate-level data continue to accord with the 
original 1978 study designated type of race for MS03, NY19 and NY38.
1984 NOTE:
1 case in TX22 and 1 case in WA01 were mistakenly coded 65 in the 
Study dataset and have been corrected to 55 here. Also, 1 case in WI05 
was mistakenly coded 13 and has been corrected to 14 here.  1 case in 
OH08 and 1 case in WI09 were mistakenly coded 12 and have been 
corrected to 21 here.  Finally, 4 cases in CA38 were incorrectly coded 
(1 as 13, 3 as 21) and have been corrected to 12 here.  These changes 
have been reflected in VCF1004 and VCF1005.
1992 NOTE 1:
For panel cases, this provides the type of race for the 1992 
congressional district of R's original address (1990) rather than the 
address to which R may have moved by the time of the 1992 interview(s).
1992 NOTE 2:
Late in 1994, it was discovered that in 50 cases an incorrect CD number 
had been assigned.  These errors affect all questions related to House 
race which were administered according to assigned-CD candidate names.  
In the introduction to this codebook is a listing of case IDs with 
correct districts, however no data have been changed in this file as a 
result.  Users can delete these cases from affected vars if desired.
1994 NOTE:
Codes represent type of race in district of interview location for the 
current Study year.
1996 NOTE 1:
same as 1994.
1996 NOTE 2: 
14 Pre interviews were conducted before the status of the congressional 
race in R's district assumed its final form.  These cases are flagged 
in 1996 Study variable V960127, and the race type projected at the time 
the Pre interview was administered is documented in 1996 Study variable 
V960128. (In such cases Pre survey data are consistent with V960128.)
1998 NOTE:  
2 districts had the incorrect type of race identified, and the 1998 
instrument was administered according to the incorrect type of House 
race.  Cumulative Data File variables utilize 1998 data which have not 
had corrections made:  In 1998, cases in AL07 should have been type 
race 14 (instead of 24); cases in CA41 should have been type race 55 
(instead of 12).
2000 NOTE:  
3 cases were misidentified PA in the Preload but should have been NJ. 
These cases are coded 00.
2002 NOTE:
Code 55 includes 2 cases from LA05 where a Democratic and 2 Republican
candidates were running.
2004 NOTE:
The extent of the Texas redistricting prior to the 2004 election 
produced House races with incumbents running in areas where he or 
she had provided little or no prior representation, thus no Texas 
candidate has been identified as a true incumbent (running or 
retiring) for the new Texas districts (House type race 44-49).
2008 NOTE:
In 22 Post-election cases, the incorrect Congressional district 
was identified for the Respondent's location in the Post preload; 
these cases are coded 00.

=============================================================================

QUESTION:
---------
Think of [Democratic candidate] [who has been the U.S. Representative
from this district/ who ran for the U.S. House of Representatives from
this district].
Have you come into contact with or learned anything about (him/her)
through any of these ways?

     (1984); short form IW (1992)
0.   No Democratic candidate running
Inap. question not used

NOTES:
------
1984 NOTE:
If R was in a district where no Democratic candidate was running BUT 
the interview administered was a telephone IW, then VCF0928-935 have 
been coded 9, not 0.  If R was in a district where no Democratic 
candidate was running BUT the interview administered was an abbreviated 
telephone IW, then VCF0936 has been coded 9, not 0.
1986 NOTE:
In the 1986 Study dataset, 8 major party challengers to the running 
U.S. House incumbent were mistakenly excluded from challenger data (SEE 
VCF0919).  Two of the omitted challengers were Democratic:  contact 
data for them appear in code 9 (NA) in VCF0928- VCF0936 and VCF0948.

[second candidate in district where 2 candidates ran] was already in the 
U.S. House of Representatives before the election? 
(IF YES AND 2 MAJOR PARTY CANDIDATES IN DISTRICT:) Which {candidate} was

VALID_CODES:
------------
1. CORRECT:  correct incumbency status; correct candidate
   [districts w/incumbents running with major party
   opposition]
2. INCORRECT:   incorrect incumbency status; incorrect
   candidate  [districts w/incumbents running with major
   party opposition]

   (1984); Washington D.C.; short form (1992)
Inap. question not used

NOTES:
------
See VCF0977.
GENERAL NOTE:
If no incumbent was running in R's district and R replied "yes" (1 or
2 major party candidates), then 2 has been coded.  If an incumbent was
running unopposed in R's district and R answered "yes," then 1 has
been coded.
If an incumbent was running with major party opposition in R's district 
and R answered "yes," then R has been coded according to whether R 
correctly identified WHICH candidate was the incumbent.
If R responded that "both" candidates were incumbents but R did not 
live in one of the districts where two 'incumbents' were actually 
running (due to redistricting), then R's response has been considered 
'incorrect'.  If, however, there actually were two 'incumbents' in R's 
congressional district, then an answer of 'both' OR an answer of either 
of the two incumbents' names has been considered 'correct'.
2000 DATA: 
1 case where respondent's district was NA and 3 cases where respondent 
district was misidentified have been coded 9.

Was there anything in particular that you liked about {NAME}, the
Democratic candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives?

7.   DK if liked anything about candidate; liked
     something about candidate but DK what
8.   No Democratic candidate in R's district (includes

9.   NA if liked anything about candidate; liked
     something about candidate but NA what; no Post
     IW; abbrev. telephone IW (1984); short form (1992);
     district NA (2000); district misidentified (2000)
Inap. question not used

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
Four possible mentions were coded in all original study datasets except
1988 and later, which coded 5.
Rs who responded "no" to "Is there anything in particular that you
liked about the US House Democratic candidate?" have been coded here
as 0 mentions.  "DK" responses to this question and "I don't know
anything about this candidate" responses have been maintained as MD
codes, unlike VCF0401-402 and VCF0405-406, because of the very high
numbers of respondents falling into these categories [for consistency,
NA responses to this question have also been retained as MD].  In
addition, if R responded "yes" to "Is there anything in particular
that you liked about the US House Democratic candidate" but R provided
no mentions (DK or NA in first mention), then R has been coded in
the corresponding MD category in VCF0980.
In 1996 and later, randomization occurred for the order in which the
Democratic and Republican House candidate names were administered for
the set of 'likes/dislikes' questions.
1984 AND 1992 NOTE:
For 1984 and 1992:  if R was in a district where no Democratic
candidate was running BUT the interview administered was an
abbreviated telephone interview (1984) or a short form interview
(1992), then VCF0980 has been coded 9, not 8.
1998 NOTE:  
1 case (0062) that was coded "yes" in the 1998 study data as response 
whether there was anything R liked about the Democratic House candidate 
should have been coded "I don't know anything about this candidate" but 
has been correctly categorized in variables VCF0980 and VCF0981.

       (2000)
Inap. question not used

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
Four possible mentions were coded in all original study datasets except
1988 and later, which coded 5.
Rs who responded "no" to "Is there anything in particular that you
liked about the US House Republican candidate?" have been coded here
as 0 mentions.  "DK" responses to this question and "I don't know
anything about this candidate" responses have been maintained as MD
codes, unlike VCF0401-402 and VCF0405-406, because of the very high
numbers of respondents falling into these categories [for consistency,
NA responses to this question have also been retained as MD].  In
addition, if R responded "yes" to "Is there anything in particular
that you liked about the US House Republican candidate" but R provided
no mentions (DK or NA in first mention), then R has been coded in
the corresponding MD category in VCF0980.
In 1996 and later, randomization occurred for the order in which the
Democratic and Republican House candidate names were administered for
the set of 'likes/dislikes' questions.
1984 AND 1992 NOTE:
For 1984 and 1992:  if R was in a district where no Republican
candidate was running BUT the interview administered was an
abbreviated telephone interview (1984) or a short form interview
(1992), then VCF0980 has been coded 9, not 8.
1998 NOTE:  
1 case (0062) that was coded "yes" in the 1998 study data as response 
whether there was anything R liked about the Republican House candidate 
should have been coded "I don't know anything about this candidate" but 
has been correctly categorized in variables VCF0980 and VCF0981.

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
In the original ANES datasets 1978 and later, the recall variables
which appeared had codes comparable to the codes appearing VCF1006-
VCF1008.  Prior to 1978, however, recall vars in ANES datasets were
coded quite differently, and translating pre-1978 recall data into
VCF1006-1008 data involves lengthy case-by-case consultation to
reference sources for type of race in R's congressional district.
Among pre-1978 studies, recall data have been incorporated for 1970 and 
1974 only.  NO attempt has been made to include recall data from ANES 
studies prior to 1970.  
1970 AND 1974 NOTE:
every House candidate was assigned a unique candidate number.  Correct 
names of candidates given by R in response to the recall question were 
coded within 1970 Study data by that individual candidate  number.
Indications are that, if the name mentioned by the respondent was not
on a complete list of candidates and candidate numbers which existed
for R's STATE, then the response was simply coded as 'incorrect.'
However, it is not apparent that any attempt was made to ascertain
whether a name "correctly" given was actually a correct name from the
congressional race in R's own district:  if R correctly named a
candidate from another-- or wrong-- district within the state, the
response was still included among 'correct' responses.  For VCF1006-
VCF1008, individual candidate numbers within the original 1970 recall 
var have been examined on a case-by-case basis to determine if the 
candidate number given by R corresponded to a name from the race in R's 
own congressional district.  If so, the response has been included as a 
recall.  If not, the response has been coded as no recall (99 MD).  
This same procedure was followed for including 1974 data, although the 
1974 study's method for handling individual candidate codes of names 
outside R's district of residence was not specifically described in any 
1974 study documentation.  Additional note for 1970 and 1974:   to 
create the specific candidate-type codes which appear in CDF VCF1006-
VCF1008, each correctly recalled name (once determined appropriate to 
R's congressional district) was checked individually according to type 
of race to determine the named candidate's exact status (e.g., 
Republican incumbent, etc.).
WARNING NOTE:  
The procedures used in the creation of VCF1006-1008 for 1970 and 1974 
produced data that have been checked somewhat, but perfect accuracy 
cannot be completely guaranteed due to the nature of attempting case-by-
case correction. Data in VCF1006-1008 for 1970 and 1974 should be used 
with caution and at the user's risk.

Inap. question not used

NOTES:
------
Built from GENERAL NOTE:
The respondent has been considered a partisan if R was 'strong', 'weak' 
or 'leaning'.
In 1978 and later, R selected name from ballot card.  When R gave a 
name not on the candidate list, MD was coded, and party of vote was 
undetermined.
In 1970-1976, every House candidate was assigned a unique candidate 
number.  Rs who reported their House vote were coded into two 
variables, the first of which recorded the candidate number of the 
named candidate, if the name was correctly given.  If the name 
mentioned by the respondent was not on the complete list of candidates 
and candidate numbers, then the response was simply coded as 
'incorrect.'  The respondent was then asked for the party of the 
candidate which s/he named.  VCF1011-1013 WERE BUILT FOR 1970-1976 
USING THE SECOND, OR "PARTY OF VOTE," VARIABLE (even in cases where the 
party given by R was not appropriate for a correctly rendered candidate 
name).  [NOTE:  if name given in 1970-1976 was 'incorrect' or DK/NA, 
"party of vote" variable was still used unless missing data:  if "party 
of vote" was missing data and name was 'incorrect' or DK/NA, vote in 
VCF1011-1013 has been coded 9.]  Note that VCF0707, VCF0736 vote vars 
were also created from this "party of vote" variable for 1970-1976, but 
the vote data present in VCF1011-1013 differ slightly from that in 
VCF0707 and VCF0736 in 1970-1976 for the following cases:  if R 
correctly gave the name of a candidate who was on the complete list of 
candidates and candidate numbers BUT did not provide any party 
designation (DK or NA) in the followup 'party of vote' var, then the 
party of the candidate correctly named in the first recall (name) var 
was ascertained and incorporated into VCF1011-1013.  This procedure was
not undertaken for 1970-1976 in vars VCF0707 and VCF0736, which retain
these cases as missing data.
Note that, because no ballot card was used, for 1968-1976 the party
for which R claimed to have voted in the House election is represented
in VCF1011-1013 even for so-called 'impossible' cases:  e.g., when R
declares R voted for a Democrat when R lives in a Congressional 
district in which only a Republican incumbent ran in the House 
election: in such a case, VCF1011-1013 are coded as if R did indeed 
vote for a Democrat.
1968 NOTE:
R's response to the House vote question was coded into a single summary 
variable which provided categories to establish whether R provided a 
correct or incorrect Democratic House candidate name, a correct or 
incorrect Republican House candidate name, a party mention only, or a 
minor party/write-in/unidentifiable candidate name.  This 1968 variable 
was accompanied by the following note:  "When R's mention of candidate 
name and party were inconsistent, the response was coded as if party 
were the dominant element.  Example:  R mentioned 'Burke, a Democrat' 
but Burke was a Republican.  Response was coded 'incorrect Republican 
candidate.'" For VCF1011-1013, party of R's 1968 House vote was taken 
from this variable.

VCF1012        R Vote Summary: Vote for House Incumbent
=============================================================================

QUESTION:
---------
Did R vote for incumbent?

VALID_CODES:
------------
1.  R's Vote: for incumbent candidate in race involving
      running incumbent
2.  R's Vote: for candidate other than incumbent in race
      involving running incumbent (1970-1988:  incl. 3rd
      party/ind. candidates)

MISSING_CODES:
--------------
9.  R did not vote or DK/NA if voted; R voted but
    not (or DK/NA if) in House race; DK/NA who voted for;
    no incumbent running in congressional district; R
    voted for name not on candidate list (1978-1990); R
    voted for third party/independent candidate who is
    not an incumbent (1990 and later); R voted out of
    district, NA if incumbent (91,92 in VCF0735);
    Washington D.C.; no Post IW; California (1974 only,
    due to redistricting type of race could not be
    determined)
Inap. question not used

NOTES:
------
See VCF1011.
GENERAL NOTE:
Beginning in 1990 Study data,  third party and independent candidates 
were combined with unknown names coded in 'name not on candidate list' 
(code 97) whenever the non-major party candidate was not on the 
Candidate List; only independent or 3rd party candidates who were on 
the Candidate List were given a separate code (code 30).
In 1970-1988, independent or 3rd party candidates could be coded
distinct from 'name not on candidate list' even if their name was
NOT on the Candidate List.  For 1970-1988, if R voted for a third
party or independent candidate who was not the incumbent, then
VCF1012 has been coded 2 even if the candidate's name was not on the 
Candidate List.
WARNING NOTE:  
In years prior to 1978, no 'type of race' var was present in Study
data.  Data were added, however, to 'type of race' VCF0902 for 1970, 
1974 and 1976 using a lengthy case-by-case procedure.  Although the 
resultant 'type of race' data have been checked to some extent, the 
possibility of some error must be recognized:  the 'type of race' 
established for 1970, 1974 and 1976-- and, as a further result, data in 
VCF1012 for 1970, 1974 and 1976-- should be used with caution and at 
the user's risk.  
1974 NOTE:
California data for VCF1012 is not recoverable because 'type of  race' 
in California districts for the 1974 election can not be determined.
1992 NOTE:
1 case [2063] which was erroneously coded to candidate code 34 for 
House  vote but which should have been code 32 is coded 9 here.

VCF1013        R Vote Summary: Vote for House Winner

QUESTION:

VALID_CODES:
------------
1.   R's Vote: for winner
2.   R's Vote: for candidate other than the winner (incl.
     names not on candidate list)

MISSING_CODES:
--------------
9.   R did not vote or DK/NA if voted; R voted but not
     (or DK/NA if) in House race; DK/NA who voted for;
     Washington D.C.; no Post IW; R voted outside
     his/her district of interview (1978-later only, not
     determinable prior to 1978)
Inap. question not used

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
Built using VCF1014 (except 1974).
See notes VCF1011 describing process which establishes who R voted
for. Note the following exception for 1974 California cases:  Rs who
gave the party of their vote BUT who gave an 'incorrect' [or DK/NA]
name could not be traced to their congressional district number which
was in effect after the 1974 redistricting in CA, so that party of
winning candidate was unknown:  all such cases have been coded 2 here
[25 cases].
1974 NOTE:
The winners in the 1974 California House congressional races which were 
mistakenly overlooked in the 1974 Study release have been restored 
here.  (Note, however, that 1974 California data for VCF1014 'Who Won' 
is not recoverable.)
WARNING note:  
The procedures used in the creation of the VCF1014 'winner'
var produced data that have been checked somewhat, but perfect
accuracy cannot be completely guaranteed due to the nature of
attempting coding from reference material.  The possibility of some
error must be recognized and the 'winner' established in VCF1014
--and, as a further result, data in VCF1013 (which has been built
using 'winner' data) -- should be used with caution and at the user's
risk.

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
In Pre-Post study years, this was a pre var.
In 1968-1978, if number of years given included a fraction of 6 or
more months, then the number of years coded was rounded up to the next
highest whole number.   In 1980-1986, this practice was restricted to
instances where the total number of years (and months) given was less
than 2 years; if the number of years given was greater than 2, then
any fraction was dropped.
In 1988-1990, all fractions of years were dropped with the exception
of months less than a year (coded as 1 year, code 0), and 13-23 months
(code 1). In 1994 and later, all fractions of years were dropped with
the exception of months less than a year (coded 0); the code "13-23
months; 2 years" has been recoded to 2.
1974 NOTE:
Code "all of life" was not used.
2002 NOTE:
This question was asked only of Fresh Cross respondents.
2004 NOTE:
Code 76 includes, "76 years or more."  Code, "All of life"
was not used.

This is a follow-up to VCF0704-VCF0706.
GENERAL NOTE:
In 1952,1956,1960,1964 no category appeared (coded) for "no preference."
Although a category appeared for "no preference" in 1968, R was not
asked the filter question, "Did you prefer one of the candidates for
president?" and the absence of this filter was reflected in the small
1968 "no preference" N (presumably volunteered responses). In 1980, 
1984, 1988 and 1992 Rs who replied "no" to the filter question were 
coded 7 here.
1956 NOTE:
One case from dual "nonvoter, NA preference; voted but not for 
president" has been coded 9 here.  
1968 NOTE:
One case originally coded "Nixon or Wallace" has been coded 9 here.
2004 NOTE:
Code 5, "Ralph Nader" and code 7, "Other" have been coded 3 here.

     D.C.)
Inap. question not used

NOTES:
------
See Appendix note "STATES AND PARTIES OF ELECTIONS/CANDIDATES".
GENERAL NOTE:
Ballot card was not used until 1978.  In 1978-1982, 1986 R selected
name from ballot card.  When R gave a name not on the candidate list,
MD was coded, and party of vote was undetermined.
In 1952, 1958, 1964-1968 (no ballot card), when an incorrect name--
i.e., not on the candidate list--was given with a party association,
the party given was coded.  When a correct name was given with an
incorrect party, then the actual party associated with the named
candidate was coded: "Smith, a Democrat" was coded as a Republican if,
in fact  (contrary to R's perception) Smith was indeed a Republican.
In 1970-1976 (no ballot card), R's perception of candidate's party was
given.  If an incorrect name (not on the candidate list) was given,
party associated was still coded.  If a given party was not the actual
party of a correctly named candidate, party as given was still coded.
In 1952, 1958, 1960 and 1964, this question was coded as a multiple
response variable allowing, when applicable, for candidate-at-large 
mentions (2nd response) as well as district choice of candidates (1st
response).  Second responses were excluded in coding VCF9025.
If R did not vote AND R's state did not have a gubernatorial race,
then 0 (not 9) has been coded.
In 1980, 1982, 1986, 1990:  if there was no race in state of IW BUT it
was determined that R voted outside of state of IW AND R designated
his/her vote for governor in the other state, then this variable has
been coded for the party of R's "outside" vote, not coded 0 MD (no
race in state).  Before 1980, it was not determined whether R voted
outside of state of IW, and no information was previously available
for any votes for governor outside of state of IW.

'Caucus' was not specified.
1972 NOTE 2: 
This question was only asked of Rs who said they were registered 
(eligible) to vote; if NA whether registered/ eligible or R didn't know 
if R was registered/eligible, then R was not asked this question.  
Additionally, in 1976, R was first asked the question whether R 
recalled if R's state had a primary during the spring/summer of the 
study year:  if R did recall whether there was a primary AND if R's 
state did indeed have a primary, then this question was asked.
1976 NOTE 1:
same as 1972 note 1.
1976 NOTE:
same as 1972 note 2.
1980 NOTE 1:
same as 1972.
1980 NOTE 2:
votes in nonmajor party primaries were not accounted for (no code 5).
1980 NOTE 3:
Several states had only one primary for one major party.  In 1980
Arkansas held a Democratic primary; South Carolina held a Republican
primary; and Mississippi held a Republican primary.  If R indicated
that R voted in the party's primary that year, then R was coded here
for the party of the primary held.  The question asked in Arkansas,
South and Carolina and Mississippi in 1980 was: Your state held a
primary election on [date].  As you may know, the [Democratic/
Republican] party did not have a primary contest in [state] this year,
so there was only a [Democratic/Republican] primary election. Did you
vote in that election or were you unable  to do so?
1988 NOTE 1:
All states represented in the time series study had a primary or 
caucus.  However, in some states (Kansas, Michigan and Wyoming
Democratic and Republican caucuses were held on separate dates and the
lead-in question was modified accordingly.

0. R did not vote in previous election; R has never voted
Inap. question not used

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
This question refers to the Presidential election preceding the current 
year.
In 1952-1960,1964-1972,1976,1980, if R answered the filter, "In the 
elections for president since you have been old enough to vote, would 
you say that you have voted in all of them, most of them, some of them, 
or none of them?" with "none of them" or answered that s/he was never 
before able to vote because s/he was previously not a citizen or old 
enough, then this question was not asked.  
In 1956, 1960, 1976 and 1980, if it was NA whether R had ever voted,
then this question was not asked.  In 1968, if R DK whether R had ever 
voted, then this question was not asked.
In 1962, 1982, 1988, 1990 and 1992 no filter was used, but Rs who did
not vote in the previous presidential election because of age or
citizenship ineligibility (or for any other reason) were simply coded
"did not vote".
In 1956, 1958, 1960, and 1964 the study  documentation stated that 
residents of Washington D.C. were INAP; however, in the data, it 
some Washington D.C. residents were INAP while others were not.
1952 NOTE 1:
Code 9 contains 9 cases of respondents who replied that they "thought" 
they had voted Democratic in 1948 and 3 cases of respondents who 
replied that they "thought" they had voted Republican in 1948.  
1952 NOTE 2:
In the original 1952 dataset, 1948 presidential votes for two
specified nonmajor party candidates were individually coded, and there
also appeared a combination category labeled "other or NA or DK who"
(9 cases).  Rs who said they had voted for the specified nonmajor
party candidates in 1948 have been coded 5 here, while Rs from the
combination category of the original 1952 dataset have been coded 3
here.
1956 NOTE:
All cases (unknown number) of Rs who only "thought" they voted for any 
particular candidate in 1952 were combined with other missing data:  
these cases are coded 9 here.

Some people feel that if black people (1964,1968: negroes) are not

Have you had enough interested in this question to favor one side over
the other?
1964,1968,1972:
(IF YES) How do you feel? Should the government in Washington see to
it that black people get fair treatment in jobs or should the
government in Washington leave these matters to the states and local
communities?

(IF YES) How do you feel? Should the government in Washington see to
it that black people get fair treatment in jobs or is this not the
federal government's business?

California this year.  Do you happen to remember what the candidates'
names were

NOTES:
------
1974 NOTE:
1974 data are not coded comparably.
1978 NOTE:
NA in code 9 also includes "NA name, DK party."
1992 NOTE:
In California in 1992, in addition to the regular Senate election a
second "special" Senate election was held and 4 --rather than 3 --
Senate recall mentions were coded for CA only in the original data.
For 1992 CA cases, CDF vars VCF9064-9066 are coded only for mentions
which are not mentions of "special" election candidates (not candidate
'93' nor '94' in the original study data).  If a 1992 California
respondent has recall but R's ONLY mention(s) refer to the special
election candidates, then 8 has been coded in VCF9064-9066 [98 in
VCF9067].

BEFORE the 1982 redistricting has been considered R's 'incumbent' for
Cumulative Data File definition.  See note VCF0902 describing the
congressional districts affected and designation of candidates as the

QUESTION:
---------
2004:
Please look at page [page] of the booklet.
Some people think the government should provide fewer

000. Records not checked (1984,1986 only)
Inap. question not used

NOTES:
------
GENERAL NOTE:
Vars VCF9149-9155 are variables related to special Vote Validation
studies which have been conducted for some years of the ANES time
series. Vote validation studies were conducted in 1964, 1976, 1978,
1980, 1984, 1986, 1988, and 1990.  Information available in the
Study data across these years varies in completeness and coding; for 
some of these years the Study data do not provide information (or 
sufficient information) to code some variables VCF9149-9155.
This is the jurisdiction, county or municipality in which
registration and voting records are located for persons living in the
particular sample segment in which R was living when interviewed.
In 1988 and 1990 only, if records were not checked for R, the vote
validation office number which would have been assigned to R if
his/her records had been checked was coded.
In 1984 and 1990 only, if R reported that s/he was registered outside
of the sample area, telephone contact with the outside  election
office was made to attempt to elicit registration and vote information
about R.  In 1986 and 1988, no such attempt was made, and Rs who self-
reported their registration outside the sample area were not included
in vote validation checks for those years.
Note that in 1986 1 case coded 87 and 2 cases coded 152 in the
original office number variable (VCF0772) should have been MD (records
not checked/ registered out of area); they are corrected here (000).
For a description of cases in code 000 SEE VCF9152 (codes 2-7).

NOTES:
------
See note VCF9149.
GENERAL NOTE:
Code 1:   For 1984 and 1990, code 1 includes telephone attempts at
validation of cases registered outside of sample  area (998 in
VCF9149). Similar attempts were not made in  other years. For 1980, 
code 1 includes 31 cases (code 9 in original var 1207) where respondent 
was discovered to be registered at a different address: note, however, 
that for these cases no effort was subsequently made to
Code 2:   Applies to 1984-1990 only.  In 1984-1990, vote validation
was intended for Rs who: 1) reported that they voted;  or 2) reported 
that they didn't vote but were registered; or 3) had no post IW.
That is, in years 1984-1990, POST RS WHO DID NOT REPORT THAT THEY WERE
REGISTERED WERE NOT VALIDATED.
Codes 3-7: All years:  complications in the ability to carry out
registration records-checks prevented the validation of registration
status for some Rs for whom validation was originally intended.
Validation was intended in 1984-90 for all Rs except nonvoters who
didn't report being  registered.  Prior to 1984, vote validation was
intended for all ANES respondents [exception:  alidation was not
intended for 1964 no-posts (code 5).  Validation was not intended for
1976 no-posts, however ANES was able to carry out validation for some
1976 no-posts.]
Code 4:  although registration status was not checked (assumed
unnecessary), voting records WERE checked (for 1980, 1 in VCF9153).
1986 NOTE:
4 cases for which validation was not attempted (due to insufficient 
address, no name, or registered out of area) were mistakenly coded 
"attempted."  They are corrected in VCF9152 (code 3) and in VCF9154-
9155 (code 0).
1976 NOTE:
Only 1976 time-series respondents who also participated in the 1972-
1974-1976 panel study (ICPSR 7607) were included in 1976 vote
validation.  In vars 9151,9152,9154,9155, 1976 prepost Rs who did not 
also participate in the panel study are INAP.

Inap. question not used

NOTES:
------
See note VCF9149,VCF9152.
GENERAL NOTE:
This variable basically describes conditions at the records office
identified in VCF9149:
A- If R's election office was identified in VCF9149 then VCF9153 has
been coded-- regardless whether R was validated or not
applies specifically to 1988,1990).
B- In 1984 and 1986, R's records office was not identified if R
was unvalidated (0 in VCF9149): 1984 and 1986 unvalidated Rs
appear in MD code 0.
C- Records offices were not identified at all prior to 1984,
however some (limited) information about cases of inaccessibility
of voting records was obtained during 1980, 1978 and 1976.  Note
that all 1976-1980 cases have been coded 1 except for such
exceptions (described below and coded 5) and for name/address
problems (code 3).
In 1978 and 1976, identification of records office (VCF9149) was not
established, and minimal information about condition/accessibility of
office records was collected.  Information available from 1978  is
that in 32 cases (8 in original var 1409) of Rs with active
registration (coded 1 in VCF9152), interviewers were unable to check
voting records at all:  these cases have been coded 5 in VCF9153.
Similarly, information available from 1976 indicates that in 31 cases
of Rs (weighted:  code 8 in original var 5012) with active
registration status (coded 1 in VCF9152), interviewers were unable to
check vote records:  these cases have also been coded 5 in VCF9153.
No cases in VCF9153 are coded 2 for 1978 or 1976.
Code 1:   1984:  includes 40 cases which were coded 67, 68, or 998 in
VCF9149 (election office) and which were labeled "problem with
registration records" in the original dataset's variable (V1129).
For all but 11 of these 40 cases, however, a voting record was found,
and, of the 11 for whom no voting record was subsequently found, 7 were 
cases of telephone (limited) attempt at validation.
Code 3:   Except for 1984 and 1986, code 3 encompasses situations in
which it was impossible to check specifically for R's records. 
Information identical to code 3 for 1984 and 1986 is found in 
VCF9152 code 3.
Code 5:   1984:  No cases appear in code 5 for 1984, because the
original dataset variable combined cases of voting records "wholly OR
partially unavailable" into a single code category (contained here in
code 2).

collected.  Information available is that in 1980 in Montgomery County 
Alabama, Madison County Alabama, and  Acadia Parish Lousiana, the 
electoral offices would not allow any voting records to be accessible 
(20 cases, 5 in VCF9153)-- although the office had already allowed 
verification of registration status (coded 1 in VCF9152).  There are no 
cases in code 2 for 1980.

NOTES:
------
See note VCF9149,VCF9152.
GENERAL NOTE:
Note that information describing status [code 2] of non-active files
was not collected systematically before 1984.  Non-active-
registration  cases prior to 1984 appear in either code 1 or code 5,
with the following exceptions:  in 1978, original var 1408 indicated
whether registration records were eligible/active on election day (or
ineligible/inactive); 53 cases of inactive registration in 1978 have
been coded 2.  Similarly, in 1976,  original var 5003 indicated a
registration record but inactive for 70 cases, who have been coded 2
in VCF9154.
Code 1 includes several cases identified as 'registration record
found, NA if active/inactive' (applies specifically to 1988,1990).
Code 2 for 1990 includes 1 case of "other" inactive file and 2 cases
of "NA" type of inactive file.
1976 NOTE:
Only 1976 time-series respondents who also participated in the 1972-
1974-1976 panel study (ICPSR 7607) were included in 1976 vote
validation.  In vars 9151,9152,9154,9155, 1976 prepost Rs who did not
also participate in the panel study are INAP.

Inap. question not used

NOTES:
------
See note VCF9149,VCF9152.
GENERAL NOTE:  
Code 3 and code 5 include cases of limited access to vote records 
(codes 2 and 5 in VCF9153).  Codes 3 and 5 also incorporate 1984 and 
1990 cases of attempted validation by phone of Rs registered out of 
area (998 in VCF9149).
In cases where registration is not required or where voting and
registration lists are for some reason kept entirely separate, this
code implies that an independent check for voting was also done and no
record of R voting was found.
In all Pre-Post years except 1964 (and some cases in 1976), this
variable includes in valid codes respondents who did not give a post-
election interview.
1964 and 1980 are the only years with cases categorized for same-day
registration.  Registration was not 'checked' in such cases but voting
records WERE checked (4 in VCF9152 and [1980] 1 in VCF9153).  The
results of the vote record checks for "same-day registration" Rs in
1964 and 1980 are represented here in codes 1 (voted) and 3 (did not
vote), with nocases of same-day registration coded 5.
1976 NOTE;
Only 1976 time-series respondents who also participated in the 1972-
1974-1976 panel study (ICPSR 7607) were included in 1976 vote
validation.  In vars VCF9151,9152,9154,9155, 1976 prepost Rs who did
not also participate in the panel study are INAP.
