			<h1>R Tutorials: Basics </h1>
			By <a href="../../"> Simon Ejdemyr </a>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="introduction"> Introduction.</a> In this first in
					a number of tutorials, we'll cover the very basics of R: how to
					execute code; how to install and load packages; style; and
					trouble shooting.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="vectors"> Vectors.</a> This tutorial introduces a
					key object in R: vectors. It explains how to create
					different types of vectors, how to subset them, how to
					modify them, and how to summarize them.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="dataset-basics"> Dataset Basics.</a> This tutorial
					introduces datasets &mdash; “data frames” in R. Datasets can
					be thought of as a collection of vectors stored as columns.
					We’ll talk about how to create datasets and how to read them
					from file. We’ll also talk more conceptually about how
					datasets should be structured.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="modifying-data"> Modifying Data.</a> Being able to
					quickly modify datasets &mdash; using tasks like subsetting,
					sorting, extracting unique observations, renaming variables,
					dropping variables, and creating new variables &mdash; is
					critical. This tutorial explains how to easily do this in R
					with functions from the dplyr package.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="collapsing-data"> Collapsing Data.</a> This
					tutorial explains how to find summary statistics for
					different categories in a dataset &mdash; what is often
					referred to as collapsing data. Like the tutorial on
					modifying data, the tutorial draws on a set of intuitive and
					elegant functions from the dplyr package.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="merging-appending"> Merging &amp; Appending.</a>
					This tutorial explains how to combine datasets by merging or
					appending them. Merging means transferring columns from one
					dataset to another, while appending means transferring rows
					from one dataset to another.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="wide-and-long"> Wide &amp; Long Data.</a>
					This tutorial explains the difference between long and wide
					form datasets, shows why it's generally preferable to use
					long form datasets, and goes over how to convert datasets
					from wide to long form.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="for-loops"> For Loops.</a>
					This tutorial explains how to write for loops &mdash; which
					can be useful when you want to iterate a process in R
					&mdash; and shows how to use for loops to carry out Monte
					Carlo simulations.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="writing-functions"> Writing Functions.</a>
					This tutorial explains how you can write your own functions
					in R. After explaining the basics, the tutorial dives into
					two data science applications for writing functions.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="tables-in-r"> Tables in R.</a>
					This tutorial explains how to create and export tables
					in R. It was originally designed for undergraduate
					students at Stanford who tend to use Word rather than
					LaTeX.
				</li>
